Mahatma Gandhi commented on the situation in Jammu on 25 December 1947 in his speech in New Delhi:

"The Hindus and Sikhs of Jammu and those who had gone there from outside killed Muslims. The Maharaja of Kashmir is responsible for what is happening there…
A large number of Muslims have been killed there and Muslim women have been dishonored."
