# StatementsOnJammuGenocide

Statements on record relating to the Jammu Genocide.

**Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi**

Mahatma Gandhi commented on the situation in Jammu on 25 December 1947 in his speech in New Delhi: 


           "The Hindus and Sikhs of Jammu and those who had gone there from outside killed Muslims. 
           The Maharaja of Kashmir is responsible for what is happening there… A large number of 
           Muslims have been killed there and Muslim women have been dishonored."

**Ved Bhasin**

           “Some of those who led the riots in Udhampur and Bhaderwah later joined the National Conference and some 
           even served as ministers,” says Bhasin, as quoted by Naqvi in his book. 
           
           Bhasin said, the Maharaja’s administration helped and “even armed the communal marauders”.
           
           Bhasin reported how several Muslims living outside Muslim-dominated areas were brutally killed by the 
           rioters who moved freely in vehicles with arms and ammunition even when the city was officially under curfew.

           “The curfew it appeared was meant only to check the movement of Muslims,” he said.
           
           `In Naqvi’s book, Bhasin recalls what then Prime Minister of J&K Mehr Chand Mahajan told a delegation of 
            Hindus who met him in the palace when he arrived in Jammu: ` 
           
           ‘Now when the power is being transferred to the people, you should demand parity.’

           One of them associated with National Conference asked Mahajan how could they demand parity when there
           was so much difference in population ratio.

           “Pointing to the Ramnagarrakh below,” Bhasin said, “where some bodies of Muslims were still lying, 
           Mahajan replied, ‘the population ratio too can change.’ ”

**Sheikh Abdullah**

In a speech at Panthal on the occasion of the inauguration of a canal in April, 1951, Abdullah observed :

           "I want to tell those people who are anxious to bring back the Maharaja that Hari Singh will never return 
           to the State. He has massacred the Muslims of this place. His wife also was his accomplice in these 
           nefarious actions. There is no room for any murderer in this State".
           
These speeches which he delivered on 16th, 17th and 18th of November 1947 were considered so important by the National
Conference that they were published in a booklet form entitled Khutbat-i-Sher-i-Kashmir
by the Party. In his speech at the Museum Ground (Jammu) delivered to ‘fifty thousand’ people Abdullah declared :
           
           “I want to tell the Hindus of Jammu who are raising the slogan of
           ‘Maharaja Bahadur ki Jai' (Long live Maharaja Bahadur) that I have no
           difference with the slogan ; but I want to ask this much. Do you want to
           see the Maharaja Bahadur as the king of only the Jammu city or the
           whole State? You have to decide this, if you want to keep him as the king
           of only one or two districts you can surely do so and I know that you have
           arranged thus. You have emptied this area of the Muslims. But my
           desire is that the Maharaja Bahadur should remain the king of the whole
           of Jammu and Kashmir and not only of two or three districts.”
           
           In his autobiography, ‘The Flames of the Chinar‘, Abdullah writes: “Upon reaching Jammu,
           Maharani Tara Devi and he (Singh) distributed arms among communal Hindus and RSS volunteers.
           The Muslims of #Jammu were assured of a safe-conduct to Pakistan but were massacred at a place
           called Saubha. No doubt these killings were organized by the Maharaja, his bigoted wife and
           (then prime minister of Jammu and Kashmir) Mehr Chand Mahajan.”

**Arundhati Roy**

           In Jammu, to the south, the Maharaja’s forces assisted by troops borrowed from other princely states, 
           massacred Muslims. Historians and news reports of the time estimated that somewhere between 70,000 and 
           200,000 were murdered in the streets of the city, and in its neighboring districts.

**Dr Karan Singh**

           “I recall the grim atmosphere,” writes Dr Karan Singh, in his autobiography, Heir Apparent, 
           “…we were losing control of the outer areas.” When the last prince was watching his empire’s 
           steady fall, his father Hari Singh’s exit had created an anarchic setup in Kashmir — perhaps
           paving way for the larger crisis.
           
**William W Baker**           

           According to William W Baker, Maharaja not
           only ordered the local people of Poonch to lay down their arms, but his
           order was for all Muslims of the state to voluntarily turn over all their
           weapons to his police. When his order was resisted, the Muslims, who were
           five lakh in number. Among them, two lakh were murdered and the rest
           fled for their safety to West Pakistan.
