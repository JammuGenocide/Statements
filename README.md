# StatementsOnJammuGenocide

Statements on record relating to the Jammu Genocide.

**Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi**

Mahatma Gandhi commented on the situation in Jammu on 25 December 1947 in his speech in New Delhi: 


           "The Hindus and Sikhs of Jammu and those who had gone there from outside killed Muslims. 
           The Maharaja of Kashmir is responsible for what is happening there… A large number of 
           Muslims have been killed there and Muslim women have been dishonored."

**Ved Bhasin**

           “Some of those who led the riots in Udhampur and Bhaderwah later joined the National Conference and some 
           even served as ministers,” says Bhasin, as quoted by Naqvi in his book. 
           
           Bhasin said, the Maharaja’s administration helped and “even armed the communal marauders”.
           
           Bhasin reported how several Muslims living outside Muslim-dominated areas were brutally killed by the 
           rioters who moved freely in vehicles with arms and ammunition even when the city was officially under curfew.

           “The curfew it appeared was meant only to check the movement of Muslims,” he said.
           
           `In Naqvi’s book, Bhasin recalls what then Prime Minister of J&K Mehr Chand Mahajan told a delegation of 
            Hindus who met him in the palace when he arrived in Jammu: ` 
           
           ‘Now when the power is being transferred to the people, you should demand parity.’

           One of them associated with National Conference asked Mahajan how could they demand parity when there
           was so much difference in population ratio.

           “Pointing to the Ramnagarrakh below,” Bhasin said, “where some bodies of Muslims were still lying, 
           Mahajan replied, ‘the population ratio too can change.’ ”

**Sheikh Abdullah**

In a speech at Panthal on the occasion of the inauguration of a canal in April, 1951, Abdullah observed :

           "I want to tell those people who are anxious to bring back the Maharaja that Hari Singh will never return 
           to the State. He has massacred the Muslims of this place. His wife also was his accomplice in these 
           nefarious actions. There is no room for any murderer in this State".
