Mahatma Gandhi commented on the situation in Jammu on 25 December 1947 in his speech in New Delhi:

"The Hindus and Sikhs of Jammu and those who had gone there from outside killed Muslims. The Maharaja of Kashmir is responsible for what is happening there…
A large number of Muslims have been killed there and Muslim women have been dishonored."

“Some of those who led the riots in Udhampur and Bhaderwah later joined the National Conference and some even served as ministers,” says Bhasin, as quoted by Naqvi in his book. `

**Sheikh Abdullah**

In a speech at Panthal on the occasion of the inauguration of a canal in April, 1951, Abdullah observed :

`
"I want to tell those people who are anxious to bring back the Maharaja that Hari Singh will never return to the State. He has massacred the Muslims of this place. His wife also was his accomplice in these nefarious actions. There is no room for any murderer in this State".
