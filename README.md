Statements on Record Relating to the Jammu Genocide

**Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi**

Mahatma Gandhi commented on the situation in Jammu on 25 December 1947 in his speech in New Delhi: 

"The Hindus and Sikhs of Jammu and those who had gone there from outside killed Muslims. The Maharaja of Kashmir is responsible for what is happening thereâ€¦
A large number of Muslims have been killed there and Muslim women have been dishonored."
